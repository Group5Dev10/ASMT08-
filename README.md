### Introduction: 
This project examines data from the 2019 Census Bureau's Annual Business Survey (ABS) API. Data from the survey is broken up into four topics: Company Summary, Characteristics of Business, Characteristics of Business owner, and Business Technology. Using these data, we attempt to answer the questions:
- Home ownership 
- Question 2
- Question 3
- Question 4

### Navigation: 
You will find the ETL Report, Final Project Report, and each member's Jupyter notebook in the master branch. The ETL Report outlines general steps for extracting the four datasets from the ABS API, as well as specific transformation and cleaning steps each member took to create their visualizations. The final report contains all visualizations and findings from this project.
